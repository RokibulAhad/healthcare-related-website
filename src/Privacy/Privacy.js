                        Administration of our websites and monitoring usage of our websites;
                        Internal operations, such as the use of identity-verification technologies, and the review of server logs;

                        b. Information Collected to Create an Account
                        There are times when AHA may request or require you to create an account with us in order to obtain certain services. In such cases we may collect user name or ID and password information from you. We use this information to verify users' identities in order to prevent unauthorized access to users' personal information. AHA allows account holders to elect to have the website remember their login information between visits so they do not have to log in each time. This is done by checking a box labeled "remember me" on the login page. This feature requires the placement of a small text file called a cookie (see next section) on the user's hard drive. The cookie tells the site that the user has logged in before. As part of registering for some of AHAâ€™s products and affiliates, we may collect contact and demographic information such as your name, address, email address, etc. We may also collect information regarding your personal and professional history, interests, activities, experiences and interests in health care products and services. Certain information may be required in order to complete the registration process.</p>

                        <p> c. Cookies
                        Several portions of the AHA websites use cookies. Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your computer through your Web browser. Cookies are used by most websites. We may use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (i) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during subsequent visits; (ii) provide personalized content on AHA.org and to provide targeted advertising on other sites; (iii) monitor effectiveness of marketing campaigns; (iv) record site analytics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (v) track your entries, submissions and communications. Certain features of our website require cookies in order to function properly.</p>
